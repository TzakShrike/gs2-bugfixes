Genso Suikoden II Bug Fixes Project

This project is focused on repairing the numerous bugs in the PSX versions of Genso Suikoden II.

The patch is a series of scripts that rip the data from an official disc or disc image, and create a patched disc image that can be played on an emulator or burned to a CD-ROM for use on real hardware.
